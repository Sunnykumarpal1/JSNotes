1)CallBack Hell
GetData=(data,callback)=>{
    setTimeout(() => {
        console.log("data"+data);
        if(callback){
            callback()
        }
        
    }, 3000);
  
}
GetData(1234,()=>{
    GetData(34,()=>{
        GetData(78)
    })
})

// Suppose we need asynchronous in code then we use callback 
we have 2 problem in callback
1) Callback hell
Suppose we pass callback in a function and again that callback has a callback function that is known as callback hell we our code grows in horizontel wise that is known as pyramid of doom
2) inversion of control
 here when we pass callback inside the function by that we loose the control .We don't know wheather it will be executed or not
